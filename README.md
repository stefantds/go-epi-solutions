# EPI Solutions Golang

This repo contains my solutions in Go for the problems from ["Elements of Programming Interview"](https://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/). The testing code is provided in https://github.com/stefantds/go-epi-judge, check the Readme there for help to get it running.

For anyone who wants to solve the EPI problems in Go, consider forking https://github.com/stefantds/go-epi-judge as a clean project.

This is work in progress. Check the current state [here](./progress.txt).
